# Title of Project (This is usually at the top of a repo's main README.md file.)

## Description

What I made for my milestone project is a quiz about the history of Las Vegas. I have live here in Las Vegas my whole life and seeing the rapid progress of the city astonishes me. This city was nothing more than a desert less than 100 years ago. Now, we have sports team and a movie stuido which will expand the economy and population of the city. As much as I like to see my city grow, I also like to use this passion project to educate users on the history using this fun triva game. By playing this quiz game, user may learn some lore about the city of Las Vegas and appreciate the rich history that the city offers.
